        <p>If you have a version of mysql already installed on your computer, uninstall it. <a href="https://phoenixnap.com/kb/uninstall-mysql" target="_blank">start here.</a></p>
        <p>This is because the local installation and the docker image conflict and a connection cannot be made by the app. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68922032/prisma-cannot-authenticate-database-server" target="_blank"> see here for more info.</a></p>
